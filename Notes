Want to add:

More functionality for all cameras
	- Make the camera an entity that can be seen
	- Toggle camera entity on/off

Create a BirdsEyeCamera class	
	
More functionality to the FreeRoamCamera
	- Ability to move where the camera is facing
	- Ability to have the camera zoom in/out

Terrain rendering
    - Terrain should be rendered when a player can see it
    - Player should be able to collide with outside walls of a terrain

Need to take into consideration when creating world:
Entities - texture, shape, reflectivity
Players - same as entities
Lighting - specular, diffuse
Terrain - texture, reflectivity, size
Cameras - 1st, 3rd, freeroam

Skybox settings:
Goal is to implement a setting to where I can set the day/night skyboxes with variables.
Variables:
skyboxDayTime - indicates length of day time, float value in ms
skyboxNightTime - indicates length of night time, float value in ms
skyboxTransition - indicates length of time to switch skyboxes

Clock:
The clock will shall have a timer.
The timer will go up to 24 seconds.  After 24 seconds is over, the timer resets.
1 real life min = 1 game hr
24 real life mins = 24 game hrs

Right now:
1 game hr = 3.6 secs

Want it to be:
1 game hr = 1 min

Calculation:
60 / 3.6 = 16.6667

Test Case for Hours game (hours) vs real (seconds):
1 hr = 24 secs
2 = 48
