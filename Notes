Want to add:

More functionality for all cameras
	- Make the camera an entity that can be seen
	- Toggle camera entity on/off

Create a BirdsEyeCamera class	
	
More functionality to the FreeRoamCamera
	- Ability to move where the camera is facing
	- Ability to have the camera zoom in/out

Terrain rendering
    - Terrain should be rendered when a player can see it
    - Player should be able to collide with outside walls of a terrain

Need to take into consideration when creating world:
Entities - texture, shape, reflectivity
Players - same as entities
Lighting - specular, diffuse
Terrain - texture, reflectivity, size
Cameras - 1st, 3rd, freeroam
